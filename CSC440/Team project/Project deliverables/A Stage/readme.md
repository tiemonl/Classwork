## When you submit your team project deliverables.

1. You can reuse some of B stage deliverables for A stage deliverables. But A stage is pretty open as long as you implement the standalone Python application and have all the components in the rubrics. 
1. Rename `Your Team Name` with your team name. Let's call it `TeamProject`.
2. Use `checklist.md` to make sure you added all the required project deliverables.
    * Copy files if necessary.
3. Use `A stage rubrics.docx` to grade your deliverables, delegate grading to other team, or delegate grading to the instructor.
4. Zip `Your Team Name`, for example `TeamProject`, and submit the zip file. Only the team leader need to send the instructor the zip file.
