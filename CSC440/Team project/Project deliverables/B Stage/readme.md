## When you submit your team project deliverables.

1. Use `SuperWiki` as an example of your team's deliverables. 
1. Rename `Your Team Name` with your team name. Let's call it `TeamProject`.
2. Use `checklist.md` to make sure you added all the required project deliverables.
    * Copy files if necessary.
3. Use `B stage rubrics.docx` to grade your deliverables, delegate grading to other team, or delegate grading to the instructor.
4. Zip `Your Team Name`, for example `TeamProject`, and submit the zip file. Only the team leader need to send the instructor the zip file.
