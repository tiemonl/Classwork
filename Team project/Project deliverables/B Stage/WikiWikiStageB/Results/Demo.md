Initial state of the Home page\

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 2](2ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

Initial view of the History page/accordion

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 3](3ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

Expanded out accordion which shows the history of all the saved versions of the page displaying the commit number, date, and username of who made the commit

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 4](4ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

Here we are editing the home page and adding the phrase "Additional edits being made to show a difference"

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 5](5ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

On save the page is stored into the database to keep record of the edit which you will see in the next pic

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 6](6ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

We now see our edit's representation in the history

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 7](7ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

We make a move to revert to the previous version by selecting it...

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 8](8ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

and hitting the "Go!" button.

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 9](9ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

With that, the file is reverted to it's old state.

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 10](10ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

Additionally, we can see the record of our revert in the records as well

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 11](11ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

Let's make a new page to show that it too is stored.

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 12](12ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

We'll make a page about dogs, for example.

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 13](13ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

On save it is once again saved...

![ArchiveSystemDemo pic 14](14ArchiveSystemDemo.jpg)\

and is viewable in the history!
