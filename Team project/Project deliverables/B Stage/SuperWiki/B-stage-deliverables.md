# Great Wiki: Stage B Deliverable

* Members: Freddie Mercury(Leader), James Bond (leader), Samuel Cho
* Date: 11/15/2017

## Schedule

### Schedule Overview

Work on stage B began Thursday, November 9th. Organization was rough at the time and no meetings were organized until Monday, November 13th. Freddie was not present for this date, so James and Cho discussed the plan for the project and the proposed deadline extension to Wednesday, November 22nd. The schedule went under a second revision on said date due to a lack of communication, as well as to account for the holiday (Thanksgiving). Part of the reasoning for this extension was that the team did not properly plan for the aspects of "wiki design analysis" which were not covered by the unit tests / UML already. Poor communication led to less cooperation on unit tests in particular. 

### Schedule and milestones (ver 1.0)

* 11/15/2017: We make a decision on what feature will be implemented and the programmer who implements it.

* 11/22/2017: Each team member submit thier first feature implementation and unit test results.

Note: no formal schedule existed before the week long change in deadline.
